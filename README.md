-->Built a machine learning model to analyze and predict the effects of space radiation on spacecraft systems using parameters such as orbit altitude, radiation flux, and temperature.

-->Applied feature scaling and correlation analysis to identify key factors influencing radiation damage.

-->Trained and evaluated regression and classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate radiation impact levels.

-->Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, highlighting how radiation varies with altitude and exposure time.

-->Generated insights that could assist in designing more radiation-tolerant spacecraft components and mission planning for long-duration space flights.
